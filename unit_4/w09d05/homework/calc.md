# PHP

## Lets build a calculator using PHP!

1. You will be building a calculator using PHP for use in the terminal.

## User Stories

User stories are a great way to break down what the different features of the website are, and how to structure it. They are generally written out in this form "A user should be able to...". Here are the user stories for our lab:

1. A user should be able to add numbers together.
1. A user should be able to subtract numbers.
1. A user should be able to divide numbers.
1. A user should be able to multiply numbers together.
1. A user should be able to see the output.

Clarification: the user should be able to input one number, add/subtract/multiple/or divide it by another number then press equals to see the answer.
**DO NOT** worry about chaining more than one operation/continuing with the number after pressing equals etc. All of that is bonus

### Hungry for more?

7. A user should be able to clear all operations and start from 0.
