# Regftr

An unfortunate occurrence is happening with increasing frequency. Friendships and trust are being torn asunder. The social fabric of many co-workers, friends and even families is fraying and tumbling into chaos. Too many times, gifts are regifted to the original gift-giver!

You think to yourself, there has to be a way to help! To make things better... with an app!

## Deliverables
- A PHP API that can do full CRUD a single model: gifts

- A gift should have

  - a name/description
  - an estimated value
  - the event for which it was gifted
  - the name of the person who gave the item

  - Make a file called table.sql that will have:
    - The command(s) you used to create your database and table and any seed data you generated : this is just so the hw grader can easily find and grab your SQL table schema and run it. Look at the markdown from class for an example of a CREATE TABLE... followed by a few INSERT...

### Hungry for More for Regiftr

- Create a custom route `/random` that chooses a gift at random and shows that gift's data and/or show page (many ways to do this)
- Try returning the gifts alphabetical by first name
- Try getting the average price of your gifts

## Even Hungrier for More?

Be the rep master! Do another rep!

### Add a Second Model: Person

- Add a second model to your regiftr API. This time, make it a person so you can keep track of all the people you've gotten gifts from. You decide what each person should have in this model!

### More PHP!

- Make a new php API that will help you make sense of php: Putting things in your own words, however fuzzy, can help you put all the pieces togetoher
- Make a single model that has at least:
  - title/name
  - type
  - A description of what it is/what it does, links to references
  - your current understanding rating 1 - 5

## Super Duper HFM!
- Take a look at [Tomorrow's Notes](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Software-Engineering-Immersive-Remote/SEIR-Moss/tree/master/unit_4/w10d04/instructor_notes) and try and integrate the api you just built into a React Front End!
