#The Internet


####What is the difference between a client and a server?
A server is connected directly to the internet and is accessible by clients. A client is connected to the internet through an ISP.

####What is the request-response cycle?
A server or client makes a request to a specific address for information. This information is then returned to the original requester.

####Define html
HTML is a standard markup language for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on the World Wide Web pages.

####Define http
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol. It encompasses different types of requests that a requester can make (i.e. 'GET' like we used in Project 1).


####Define 'front end'
Front end is what the client/requester sees on their web browser.

####What are the three parts of 'the backend?'
The server, application, and database. The server is directly connected to the internet, in which requestors can access the information available. The application is like what we have been building with JS. It's the functionality of the webpage. The database is all the stored information required to populate the webpage.
