Freddy Kruger decided he wanted to make a career change. He landed an awesome job that let him use Mongo Express, and EJS. So he figured he could just jump into the fruits app, change a few things around finish the project and then essentially have a few days off without telling his manager.

Freddyâ€™s manager was disappointed in him and after the kitchen fiasco, the broken window drama, and deflating all of the bean bag chairs whenever he got a bug. She felt the best option was to unhire Freddy.

You are his replacement! the manager thinks Freddy must have done a lot of work, and thinks the project is salvageable, and it is now your job to save the app!

## Instructions: Hone Your Debugging Skills

1. Mimic the real world, you are the only dev on this job. Work independently on this, the senior dev is OOO(out of office) so there will be no instructors or TA's to help you untangle Freddy's code mess. However take heart there is a BIG reward (see below)!

1. Crush the errors in the following files:

- One error in each of the views.
- One error in the model.
- Multiple errors in the controller.
- Multiple errors in the server.
- ???Mystery Error???
- Pro Tip: No errors in package-lock.json or node_modules.

## Your Reward

1. If you solve all of the bugs, and submit this lab by 6pm EST TODAY, you will get +1 homework. Which will either turn an incomplete into a complete OR you will be able to skip a homework in the future.
