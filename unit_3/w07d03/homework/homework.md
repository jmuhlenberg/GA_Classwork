#Learn About SPAs
##1. What is a Single-Page Application(SPA)?
A single-page application is a web app or website that the user interacts in the web browser that dynamically rewrites the current web page with new data. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.

##2. What is a Multi-Page Application(MPA)?
A multi-page application is what we built for Unit 2. This was probably the more traditional way applications were developed.
Every change requires a request and response back to the server to render a new page.


##3. When we built our Unit 2 apps, were they SPA or MPA, why?
They were MPAs. Each route or redirect required us to write different pages and point the server to render the new


##4. Give two pros of a SPA.
- Typically faster than a MPA
- No need to write code to render pages on the server


##5. Give two cons of a SPA.
- It is slow to download.
- Requires JavaScript to be present and enabled.


##6. Give two pros of a MPA.
- Good for users who need a visual map of where to go.
- Very good and easy for proper SEO management.


##7. Give two cons of a MPA.
- No option to use the same backend with mobild applications.
- Frontend and backend dev are tightly coupled.


#APIs
##1. What were the three great technical accomplishments of MPL?
- It served as a crack team which understood the infrastructure of the site and could resolve small issues as they arose.
- It built an insurance application, called App2, which signed up new users in less than half the time of the original app.
- It replaced the website's crashy log in system with a functional and less expensive one of its own design.


##2. What does 'API' stand for?
Application Programming Interface


##3. What is an API?
A computer interface which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries.
