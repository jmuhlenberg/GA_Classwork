# jService + Finish Happy Fun Ball 

## The Assignments 

**This weekend's homework comes in 2 main required parts:**

- [jService](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Software-Engineering-Immersive-Remote/SEIR-Moss/tree/master/unit_3/w07d05/student_labs/afternoon): Practice React and making ajax requests by making a trivia app
- [Happy Fun Ball](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Software-Engineering-Immersive-Remote/SEIR-Moss/tree/master/unit_3/w07d05/morning_exercise): Finish the morning exercise to practice git branching/merging 
  - In class, we left off at the beginning of [step 6 for link-files](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Software-Engineering-Immersive-Remote/SEIR-Moss/tree/master/unit_3/w07d05/morning_exercise#part-6---merge-dev-branch-into-master). If you did not finish all the steps before that though, please do those first!
  
## Computer Science

Alongside that, to supplement your learning, consider doing the following Computer Science modules on myGA. **You do *not* have to do all of the computer science modules weekend and there are again no deliverables for these**, you can do them on your own time throughout the entire week. Remember with these CS modules, these are all for your benefit and you can go through them on your own pace. These suggestions are just guides!

**Suggested Modules:**

- [Recursion](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/773)
- [Intro to Sorting](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/818)
- [Basic Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/778)

> If you have not gone through the [previously suggested modules](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Software-Engineering-Immersive-Remote/SEIR-Moss/blob/master/unit_2/w04d05/homework/README.md#second-section-computer-science-intro) yet, please do those first!

## Submission Guidelines 

- Open an issue like normal before the next class, please be sure to include **both** links (one to jService, one to hfb)!
