# Setting up Calculator 

![](https://i.imgur.com/LxaKMCj.png)

For today and tomorrow's morning lab, you will be building a calculator in your browser using HTML/CSS/jQuery. Today, we want you to focus on writing the HTML/CSS so that tomorrow you can focus on building out the functionality with JavaScript/jQuery

---

## Setup 

Create a directory in your student lab folder called `calculator`.

Within calculator setup an `index.html` `app.js` and `style.css` and get jQuery wired up.

## Design your calculator 

1. Before you type out your HTML, draw out how you want your calculator to look and start thinking about how to structure your html. **Note: it does not have to look like the example given above!** Don't spend more than 10 minutes thinking through this part, but put something on paper before you code. This is your chance to create a wireframe!

1. Think about where the input (buttons for numbers / operations) and output (display screen) needs to be

### Write the HTML needed 

1. Now that you have your wireframe drawn, use it to write the html needed for your calculator.

1. Think about using ids and/or classes to help you select your elements.

### Now write the CSS! 

1. Now that you have a wireframe, and that your HTML is written out -- write the CSS to style it how you like!

## Hungry for More 

1. Finished styling your calculator and are now ready to add functionality to it? Take a look at the lectures and [lab markdown](../../w03d03/student_labs/README.md) for tomorrow and see if you can figure out how to do so.
